simulation for population growth.  i put numbers for poland.  it says that,
after 1277 years, there will be 1 polish alive in his/her last year.  in 1278
years, there will be none.  read `sim.py` for actual parameters/assumptions.
but basically i assumed that fertility rate is 1.36, and i assumed that all
females will reperoduce, even tho there are less males than females.
