simulation for population growth.  i put numbers for poland.  it says that,
after 1277 years, there will be 1 polish alive in his/her last year.  in 1278
years, there will be none.  read `sim.py` for actual parameters/assumptions.
but basically i assumed that fertility rate is 1.36, and i assumed that all
females will reproduce, even tho there are less males than females.

oo.  i also assumed that all of poland's population is at age 0 now.  which is
not true, but this made the results in someway optimistic.

of course, the results are pessimistic in other ways, such as by assuming that
the birth rate of 1.36 will be constant forever.
